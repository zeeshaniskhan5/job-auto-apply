# Job Auto Apply

Automate job applications across **LinkedIn**, **Indeed**, and **Naukri** from a single tool.

---

## Features

- One-click apply on LinkedIn Easy Apply, Indeed Smart Apply, and Naukri Apply
- Run all three platforms **simultaneously** or one at a time
- Smart Q&A engine — automatically answers screening questions
- Auto resume upload
- Persistent Playwright browser sessions — log in once, never again
- Built-in stealth mode (bypasses bot detection automatically)
- Human-like typing with per-character randomized delays
- Profile bump on Naukri (pushes your profile to top of recruiter searches)
- Fully configurable via a single `config.yaml` file

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (Mac/Linux also supported)
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Your resume as a PDF file

> **No Chrome installation needed.** `setup.bat` installs Playwright's own Chromium automatically.

---

## Setup (3 steps)

### Step 1 — Run Setup
Double-click `setup.bat`

This will automatically:
1. Install Python packages (`playwright`, `pyyaml`, `colorlog`)
2. Download Playwright's Chromium browser
3. Create your `config.yaml` from the example template

### Step 2 — Edit config.yaml
Open `config.yaml` and fill in:
- Your name, phone, resume path, location, salary, experience
- LinkedIn / Indeed / Naukri email & password
- Job search keywords and location
- Custom answers to screening questions

### Step 3 — Run the Bot
Double-click `run.bat`

Choose a platform (or option 4 to run all at once):

```
[1] LinkedIn
[2] Indeed
[3] Naukri
[4] All platforms simultaneously
[0] Exit
```

## Tips

- **First run:** The Playwright browser opens and logs you in. Sessions are saved in `profile/` — future runs skip login entirely.
- **All 3 simultaneously:** Choose option `[4]` — platforms run in parallel via `asyncio.gather()`, each in its own browser window.
- **CAPTCHA:** Solve it manually in the browser window — the bot waits and continues automatically after.
- **Max applications:** Set `max_applications` in `config.yaml` to control how many jobs each platform applies to per run.
- **Screening questions:** Add keyword → answer pairs under `answers:` in `config.yaml`. The bot matches question text to your keywords automatically.
- **Resume path:** Use the full absolute path with forward slashes, e.g. `C:/Users/YourName/Documents/resume.pdf`
- **No Chrome needed:** Playwright ships its own Chromium — your system Chrome is untouched.
